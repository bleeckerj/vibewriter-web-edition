                    Vibewriter is a functional design fiction conceived within the Near Future Laboratory’s <a href="https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/blog/2025/06/artificial-intelligence-designed-fictions-research-studio/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-black">AI Designed Fictions Research Studio</a>. It is not merely a tool, but a speculation and an exploration to wander into a possible future where artificial intelligence becomes not a replacement, but a creative partner. More like a muse than a robot. Something that writes <em>with</em> you — like dancing together — rather than <em>for</em> you.
                </p>
                
                <div class="text-2xl text-center font-bold font-['3270'] text-black pt-4">A Simple UX Adjustment</div>
                <p>The UI/UX of AI has been stuck in the 'chat' idiom.</p>
                <p>Most AI writing tools speak in the language of question and answer — you ask, it responds.</p>
                <p>But true creativity is more like a flow, I would say.</p>
                <p>Something that is more like a running current that rolls around one's consciousness, like water flowing around and over rocks, catching boughs broken off and drifting downstream, always in motion.</p>
                <p>This lead to an designed fictional artifact called Ghostwriter.</p>
                <p>Ghostwriter is a desktop application that allows you to write with an AI partner, where you can write a few sentences, then the AI takes over, continuing your thought in a way that feels like a natural extension of your own writing. It’s not about replacing the writer, but enhancing the creative process through collaboration.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-['3270'] text-center font-bold text-black pt-4">The Vibe: Crossfit for Your Writer’s Brain</h2>
                <p>Ghostwriter has several modes — streaming completion, incantation, nudge, and more.</p>
                <p>When I was doing user studies with Ghostwriter, I found that the most intriguing and engaging mode was "nudge" — where the AI would take your last sentence and continue it, but in a way that felt like a gentle push rather than a full rewrite. This mode allowed for a more organic flow of ideas, where the AI acted as a creative partner rather than a replacement.</p>
                <p>I then took that mode, and tried it with more of a ludic, game-like mechanic: the AI starts writing and then stops. You (the player/writer) are meant to continue the prose semantically.</p>
                <p>The trick is — you're on a clock.</p>
                <p>You have a limited amount of time to write and continue before the AI interrupts, turns off your typing, and takes over again. This creates a playful, turn-based "trading 4's"  mode of writing, where you and the AI alternate writing, pushing each other to be more creative and spontaneous.</p>
                <p>It's hard. And fun. A bit like hefting kettlebells or doing burpees for your writer's brain (as I say..)</p>
                <p>  
                    This mechanic seems to immerse oneself in the writing flow. Anticipating that time will run out — when your intellonic muse will take up the pen — one moves quickly through ones thoughts, letting go of the kind of preventitive consciousness that puzzles long over what comes next. Then, your muse comes back to you with evocative and semantically rich text. This dynamic encourages momentum over hesitation, inviting a stream of consciousness that lets ideas spill onto the page with less self-censorship and more discovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also a satisfying middle ground between letting the AI do everything (which can feel like..well..what's the point of writing?) and struggling with the blank page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Vibeweriter was really made as an experiement to wander the new terrain we find ourselves inhabiting. What kind of worlds do we want? And I happened to wonder about a corner of oen of these possible worlds where AI is a creative partner, not a replacement, and in the context of writing and the act of words falling on a page — that was not a chat-based UI, but a flow-based UI.
                </p>
                
                <div class="text-2xl font-['3270'] text-center font-bold text-black pt-4">A Meditation on Creativity</div>
                <p>
                    Drawing from Rick Rubin’s insight that creativity is a way of being — a receptive, open state where something new finds its way through — Vibewriter is designed to nurture that state. It’s a mirror and a collaborator, reflecting your intent and pushing the edges of possibility. Like Rubin’s embrace of silence and imperfection in music, Vibewriter finds beauty in the unexpected turns and occasional clichés of AI-generated text, turning them into sparks of inspiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As writers like <a href='https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/can-ai-writing-be-more-than-a-gimmick'>Vauhini Vara</a> have shown, AI’s relationship to writing is complex — sometimes a ghostly presence, sometimes an illuminating light. Vibewriter embraces this tension, offering a space where human intention and machine generation coexist in dialogue. It’s not about losing the writer’s voice, but amplifying it through new modalities, enabling you to imagine harder and write freer.

                    This web version of Vibewriter is a working prototype within a broader vision that includes the desktop application Ghostwriter. It serves as a speculative window into a future where humans and AI share the creative journey — crafting tools that are playful, tangible, and grounded in interaction, not just code.

    Rick Rubin, The Creative Act (2023): Rubin’s exploration of creativity as “listening,” tuning in to a shared source beyond the self, and embracing imperfection deeply informs our design philosophy. Ghostwriter embodies his call for collaboration and openness, offering AI as a muse that “nudges” rather than “takes over.”<Br/>

    Hua Hsu, What Happens After A.I. Destroys College Writing? (New Yorker, 2025): The cultural disruption of AI writing has and will continue to challenge notions of authorship and raise questions about the purpose of not only writing, but our understood ways of traditional learning. The approach with Vibewriter embraces these changes — or at least is sympathetic with them — by supporting creative process and reflection through interface design, helping writers reclaim agency amidst AI’s rise.<br/>
